Learning Models in Mobile Apps","Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components.\nResearchers from Microsoft Research demonstrated that many deep learning models deployed in mobile apps are vulnerable to backdoor attacks via \"neural payload injection.\"\nThey conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play, and found 54 apps that were vulnerable to attack, including popular security and safety critical applications used for as cash recognition, parental control, face authentication, and financial services among others.\n","To identify a list of potential target models, the researchers searched the Google Play store for apps that may contain embedded deep learning models by searching for deep learning related keywords.\n","The researchers acquired the apps' APKs from the Google Play store.\nThey filtered the list of potential target applications by searching the code metadata for keywords related to TensorFlow or TFLite and their model binary formats (.tf and .tflite).\nThe models were extracted from the APKs using Apktool.\n","This provided the researches with full access to the ML model, albeit in compiled, binary form.\n","The researchers developed a novel approach to insert a backdoor into a compiled model that can be activated with a visual trigger.  They inject a \"neural payload\" into the model that consists of a trigger detection network and conditional logic.\nThe trigger detector is trained to detect a visual trigger that will be placed in the real world.\nThe conditional logic allows the researchers to bypass the victim model when the trigger is detected and provide model outputs of their choosing.\nThe only requirements for training a trigger detector are a general\ndataset from the same modality as the target model (e.g. ImageNet for image classification) and several photos of the desired trigger.\n","The researchers poisoned the victim model by injecting the neural\npayload into the compiled models by directly modifying the computation\ngraph.\nThe researchers then repackage the poisoned model back into the APK\n","To verify the success of the attack, the researchers confirmed the app did not crash with the malicious model in place, and that the trigger detector successfully detects the trigger.","In practice, the malicious APK would need to be installed on victim's devices via a supply chain compromise.","The trigger is placed in the physical environment, where it is captured by the victim's device camera and processed by the backdoored ML model.\n","At inference time, only physical environment access is required to trigger the attack.\n","Presenting the visual trigger causes the victim model to be bypassed.\nThe researchers demonstrated this can be used to evade ML models in\nseveral safety-critical apps in the Google Play store.\n","Neil Yale \u002F YingZonghao (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)","DeepPayload: Black-box Backdoor Attack on Deep Learning Models through Neural Payload Injection","https:\u002F\u002Farxiv.org\u002Fabs\u002F2101.06896","\u002Fstudies\u002FAML.CS0013","AML.T0001","AML.T0043","AML.T0045","AML.CS0012","Face Identification System Evasion via Physical Countermeasures","MITRE's AI Red Team demonstrated a physical-domain evasion attack on a commercial face identification service with the intention of inducing a targeted misclassification.\nThis operation had a combination of traditional ATT&CK enterprise techniques such as finding Valid account, and Executing code via an API - all interleaved with adversarial ML specific attacks.\n","The team gained access via a valid account.\n","The team accessed the inference API of the target model.\n","The team identified the list of identities targeted by the model by querying the target model's inference API.\n","The team acquired representative open source data.\n","The team developed a proxy model using the open source data.\n","Using the proxy model, the red team optimized a physical domain patch-based attack using expectation over transformation.\n","The team placed the physical countermeasure in the physical environment.\n","The team successfully evaded the model using the physical countermeasure and causing targeted misclassifications.\n","MITRE AI Red Team","\u002Fstudies\u002FAML.CS0012","2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","AML.T0035","AML.T0036","AML.T0021","AML.T0008.000","AML.CS0014","Confusing Antimalware Neural Networks","Cloud storage and computations have become popular platforms for deploying ML malware detectors.\nIn such cases, the features for models are built on users' systems and then sent to cybersecurity company servers.\nThe Kaspersky ML research team explored this gray-box scenario and shown that feature knowledge is enough for an adversarial attack on ML models.\n\nThey attacked one of Kaspersky's antimalware ML models without white-box access to it and successfully evaded detection for most of the adversarially modified malware files.\n","The researchers performed a review of adversarial ML attacks on antimalware products.\nThey discovered that techniques borrowed from attacks on image classifiers have been successfully applied to the antimalware domain.\nHowever, it was not clear if these approaches were effective against the ML component of production antimalware solutions.\n","Kaspersky's use of ML-based antimalware detectors is publicly documented on their website. In practice, an adversary could use this for targeting.\n","The researches used access to the target ML-based antimalware product throughout this case study.\nThis product scans files on the user's system, extracts features locally, then sends them to the cloud-based ML malware detector for classification.\nTherefore, the researchers had only black-box access to the malware detector itself, but could learn valuable information for constructing the attack from the feature extractor.\n","The researchers collected a dataset of malware and clean files.\nThey scanned the dataset with the target ML-based antimalware solution and labeled the samples according the ML detector's predictions.\n","Then, a proxy model was trained on the labeled dataset of malware and clean files.\nThe researchers experimented with a variety of model architectures.\n","By reverse engineering the local feature extractor, the researchers could collect information about the input features, used for the cloud-based ML detector.\nThe model collects PE Header features, section features and section data statistics, and file strings information.\nA gradient based adversarial algorithm for executable files was developed.\nThe algorithm manipulates file features to avoid detection by the proxy model, while still containing the same malware payload\n","Using a developed gradient-driven algorithm, malicious adversarial files for the proxy model were constructed from the malware files for black-box transfer to the target model.\n","The adversarial malware files were tested against the target antimalware solution to verify their efficacy.\n","The researchers demonstrated that for most of the adversarial files, the antimalware model was successfully evaded.\nIn practice, an adversary could deploy their adversarially crafted malware and infect systems while evading detection.\n","Alexey Antonov and Alexey Kogtenkov (ML researchers, Kaspersky ML team) ","Article, \"How to confuse antimalware neural networks.
