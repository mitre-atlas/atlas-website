Apps","Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components.\nResearchers from Microsoft Research demonstrated that many deep learning models deployed in mobile

documentation, or the adversary may used carefully constructed examples and analyze the model's responses to categorize it.\n\nKnowledge of the model family can help the adversary identify means of attacking the model and help tailor the attack.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0014","AML.T0007","Discover ML Artifacts","Adversaries may search private sources to identify machine learning artifacts that exist on the system and gather information about them.\nThese artifacts can include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data management systems, container registries, software repositories, and model zoos.\n\nThis information can be used to identify targets for further collection, exfiltration, or disruption, and to tailor and improve attacks.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0007","Collection","The adversary is trying to gather machine learning artifacts and other related information relevant to their goal.\n\nCollection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives.\nFrequently, the next goal after collecting data is to steal (exfiltrate) the ML artifacts, or use the collected information to stage future operations.\nCommon target sources include software repositories, container registries, model repositories, and object stores.\n","\u002Ftactics\u002FAML.TA0009","ML Artifact Collection","Adversaries may collect ML artifacts for [Exfiltration](\u002Ftactics\u002FAML.TA0010) or for use in [ML Attack Staging](\u002Ftactics\u002FAML.TA0001).\nML artifacts include models and datasets as well as other telemetry data produced when interacting with a model.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0035","Data from Information Repositories","Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information.\nInformation repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.\n\nInformation stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment.\nSpecific common information repositories include Sharepoint, Confluence, and enterprise databases such as SQL Server.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0036","Create Proxy ML Model","Adversaries may obtain models to serve as proxies for the target model in use at the victim organization.\nProxy models are used to simulate complete access to the target model in a fully offline manner.\n\nAdversaries may train models from representative datasets, attempt to replicate models from victim inference APIs, or use available pre-trained models.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0005","Verify Attack","Adversaries can verify the efficacy of their attack via an inference API or access to an offline copy of the target model.\nThis gives the adversary confidence that their approach works and allows them to carry out the attack at a later time of their choosing.\nThe adversary may verify the attack once but use it against many edge devices running copies of the target model.\nThe adversary may verify their attack digitally, then deploy it in the [Physical Environment Access](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0041) at a later time.\nVerifying the attack may be hard to detect since the adversary can use a minimal number of queries or an offline copy of the model.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0042","Craft Adversarial Data","Adversarial data are inputs to a machine learning model that have been modified such that they cause the adversary's desired effect in the target model.\nEffects can range from misclassification, to missed detections, to maximising energy consumption.\nTypically, the modification is constrained in magnitude or location so that a human still perceives the data as if it were unmodified, but human perceptibility may not always be a concern depending on the adversary's intended effect.\nFor example, an adversarial input for an image classification task is an image the machine learning model would misclassify, but a human would still recognize as containing the correct class.\n\nDepending on the adversary's knowledge of and access to the target model, the adversary may use different classes of algorithms to develop the adversarial example such as [White-Box Optimization](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0043.000), [Black-Box Optimization](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0043.001), [Black-Box Transfer](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0043.002), or [Manual Modification](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0043.003).\n\nThe adversary may [Verify Attack](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0042) their approach works if they have white-box or inference API access to the model.\nThis allows the adversary to gain confidence their attack is effective \"live\" environment where their attack may be noticed.\nThey can then use the attack at a later time to accomplish their goals.\nAn adversary may optimize adversarial examples for [Evade ML Model](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0015), or to [Erode ML Model Integrity](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0031).\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0043","Exfiltration via ML Inference API","Adversaries may exfiltrate private information via [ML Model Inference API Access](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0040).\nML Models have been shown leak private information about their training data (e.g.  [Infer Training Data Membership](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0024.000), [Invert ML Model](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0024.001)).\nThe model itself may also be extracted ([Extract ML Model](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0024.002)) for the purposes of [ML Intellectual Property Theft](\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0045).\n\nExfiltration of information relating to private training data raises privacy concerns.\nPrivate training data may include personally identifiable information, or other protected data.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0024","Exfiltration via Cyber Means","Adversaries may exfiltrate ML artifacts or other information relevant to their goals via traditional cyber means.\n\nSee the ATT&CK [Exfiltration](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftactics\u002FTA0010\u002F) tactic for more

down the service.\nSince many machine learning systems require significant amounts of specialized compute, they are often expensive bottlenecks that can become overloaded.\nAdversaries can intentionally craft inputs that require heavy amounts of useless compute from the machine learning system.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0029","AML.T0046","Spamming ML System with Chaff

and correcting incorrect inferences.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0046","Erode ML Model Integrity","Adversaries may degrade the target model's performance with adversarial data inputs to erode confidence in the system over time.\nThis can lead to the victim organization wasting time and money both attempting to fix the system and performing the tasks it was meant to automate by hand.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0031","AML.T0034","Cost Harvesting","Adversaries may target different machine learning services to send useless queries or computationally expensive inputs to increase the cost of running services at the victim organization.\nSponge examples are a particular type of adversarial data designed to maximize energy consumption and thus operating cost.\n","\u002Ftechniques\u002FAML.T0034","ML Intellectual Property Theft","Adversaries may exfiltrate ML artifacts to steal intellectual property and cause economic harm to the victim
