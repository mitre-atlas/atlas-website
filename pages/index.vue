            {{ mitreTitle }} ({{ longName }}), is a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and case studies for machine learning (ML) systems based on real-world observations, demonstrations from ML red teams and security groups, and the state of the possible from academic research. {{ shortName }} is modeled after the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org">MITRE ATT&CK<sup>&reg;</sup> framework</a> and its tactics and techniques are complementary to those in ATT&CK.

            {{ shortName }} enables researchers to navigate the landscape of <NuxtLink to="resources/adversarial-ml-101">
              threats to machine learning systems
            </NuxtLink>. ML is increasingly used across a variety of industries. There are a growing number of vulnerabilities in ML, and its use increases the attack surface of existing systems. We developed {{ shortName }} to raise awareness of these threats and present them in a way familiar to security researchers.
