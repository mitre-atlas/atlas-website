#### What are the ML lifecycle stages?

The machine learning lifecycle, adapted from [Crisp-ML(Q)](https://ml-ops.org/content/crisp-ml), consists of the following stages:

| Name | Description  |
|---|---|
| Business and Data Understanding            | Defining the scope and requirements of the project and collecting data |
| Data Preparation     | Data cleaning, data augmentation, and developing a robust data pipeline |
| ML Model Engineering      | Defining quality measures, selecting a model architecture, and training a model |
| ML Model Evaluation    | Increasing model explainability and ensuring that the developed model complies with project needs and satisfies risk and safety constraints |
| Deployment | Setting up production environment and productionizing the validated ML model |
|  Monitoring and Maintenance    | Continually evaluating the deployed model to ensure it continues to fulfill quality assurance measures |
