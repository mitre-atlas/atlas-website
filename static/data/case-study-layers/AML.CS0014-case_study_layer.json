In such cases, the features for models are built on users' systems and then sent to cybersecurity company servers. The Kaspersky ML research team explored this gray-box scenario and shown that feature knowledge is enough for an adversarial attack on ML models.\nThey attacked one of Kaspersky's antimalware ML models without white-box access to it and successfully evaded detection for most of the adversarially modified malware files.\n", "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "AML.T0001", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "reconnaissance"}, {"techniqueID": "T1594", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "reconnaissance"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0047", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "reconnaissance"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0002", "showSubtechniques": true, "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0002.000", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0005", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0017", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043", "showSubtechniques": true, "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043.002", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0042", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0015", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "defense-evasion"}], "legendItems": [{"label": "ATLAS technique", "color": "#C8E6C9"}]}
