  name: GPT-2 Model Replication
  summary: >
    OpenAI built GPT-2, a powerful natural language model and adopted a
    staged-release process to incrementally release 1.5 Billion parameter model.
    Before the 1.5B parameter model could be released by OpenAI eventually, two
    ML researchers replicated the model and released it to the public.

        Using the public documentation about GPT-2, ML researchers gathered
        information about the dataset, model architecture, and training
        hyper-parameters.

        The researchers obtained a reference implementation of a similar
        publicly available model called Grover.

        The researchers were able to manually recreate the dataset used in the
        original GPT-2 paper using the gathered documentation.

        The researchers were able to use TensorFlow Research Cloud via their
        academic credentials.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0005
      description: >+
        The researchers modified Grover's objective function to reflect GPT-2's
        objective function and then trained on the dataset they curated.

        They used Grover's initial hyperparameters for training.

        This resulted in their replicated model.
