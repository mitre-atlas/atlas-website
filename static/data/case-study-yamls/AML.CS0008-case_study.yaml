  name: ProofPoint Evasion
  summary: >
    CVE-2019-20634 describes how ML researchers evaded ProofPoint's email
    protection system by first building a copy-cat email protection ML model,
    and using the insights to evade the live system.

  procedure:
    - tactic: TA0042
      technique: AML.T0002
      description: >+
        The researchers first gathered the scores from the Proofpoint's ML
        system used in email headers by sending a large number of emails through
        the system and scraping the model scores exposed in the logs.

    - tactic: TA0042
      technique: AML.T0002.000
      description: |+
        The researchers converted the collected scores into a dataset.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0005
      description: >+
        Using these scores, the researchers replicated the ML mode by building a
        "shadow" aka copy-cat ML model.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0043.000
      description: >+
        Next, the ML researchers algorithmically found samples that this
        "offline" copy cat model.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0043.002
      description: >+
        Finally, these insights from the offline model allowed the researchers
        to create malicious emails that received preferable scores from the real
        ProofPoint email protection system, hence bypassing it.
