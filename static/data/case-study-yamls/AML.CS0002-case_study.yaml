study:
  name: VirusTotal Poisoning
  summary: >
    An increase in reports of a certain ransomware family that was out of the
    ordinary was noticed. In investigating the case, it was observed that many
    samples of that particular ransomware family were submitted through a
    popular Virus-Sharing platform within a short amount of time. Further
    investigation revealed that based on string similarity, the samples were all
    equivalent, and based on code similarity they were between 98 and 74 percent
    similar. Interestingly enough, the compile time was the same for all the
    samples. After more digging, the discovery was made that someone used
    'metame' a metamorphic code manipulating tool to manipulate the original
    file towards mutant variants. The variants wouldn't always be executable but
    still classified as the same ransomware family.

        The actor obtained [metame](https://github.com/a0rtega/metame), a simple
        metamorphic code engine for arbitrary executables.

        The actor used a malware sample from a prevalent ransomware family as a
        start to create 'mutant' variants.

        The actor uploaded "mutant" samples to the platform.

    - tactic: TA0003
      technique: AML.T0020
      description: >+
        Several vendors started to classify the files as the ransomware family
        even though most of them won't run.

        The "mutant" samples poisoned the dataset the ML model(s) use to
        identify and classify this ransomware family.
